# Analyzing a Phase I Clinical Trial

Welcome to the AI Hub's tutorial on analyzing Phase I Trials! This repo is made up of only a few files:

- `phase_1_trial.ipynb`
- `data/synthetic_dose_data.csv`
- `data/synthetic_participant_data.csv`
- `data_definitions.md`

We suggest you jump right into the `phase_1_trail.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. There, you will find a tutorial covering Phase I trials that reviews the .csv files mentioned above. Happy coding!
